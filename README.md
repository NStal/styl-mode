styl-mode
=========
stylus-mode is already taken, but it's hard to install and use.

styl-mode is stylus mode for emacs, most code are copied from the (great) coffee-mode and css-mode.

TODO:

[ ] add highlight (hard. since stylus is too flexible and emacs highlight reg have some bugs parsing multi lines).
[ ] built in watch.
