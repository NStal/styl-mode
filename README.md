styl-mode
=========
stylus-mode is already taken, but it's hard to install and use.
styl-mode is stylus mode for emacs, most code are copied from the (great) coffee-mode and css-mode.

TODO:

- [ ] add highlight (hard. since stylus is so flexible and emacs highlight REGEXP have some problem parsing multi lines).
- [ ] built in watch.
- [ ] maybe some hint for bad indent and tailing space
